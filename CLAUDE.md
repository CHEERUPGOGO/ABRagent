This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AutoBatteryResearch Agent (ABRAgent) — an autonomous AI research agent for high-energy-density chemical battery R&D (lithium-metal, solid-state, high-nickel NCM). It runs a 6-stage gated workflow: literature ingestion → semantic vector indexing → material mining / cell assembly → multi-agent RAG design → PINN/P2D physics simulation (skippable) → synthesis report.

Core design principle: **"LLM in the brain seat, workflow in the referee seat"** — the `ABRAgent` (LangChain/LangGraph ReAct loop) autonomously drives **all 6 stages**, while `StageManager` + deterministic `Checkers` act as guardrails that gate stage transitions. Deterministic executors in `_execute_agent_decision_loop` run after the LLM turn as an offline/failure fallback (inspect-then-execute-if-missing, idempotent), so the workflow completes even without an API key.

Comments, log messages, and docs are in Chinese; match that style.

## Commands

```

## LLM Configuration

- All LLM access goes through an **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`): MiniMax, DeepSeek, Qwen, OpenAI, Ollama, etc.
- Config lives in `auto_battery_research/setting.yaml`, which supports env-var interpolation with defaults: `$(OPENAI_API_BASE: https://api.minimaxi.com/v1)`. Env vars `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_BASE` / `OPENAI_MODEL` override. Priority: env vars > `.env` file (zero-dependency loader in `util/env_loader.py`, loaded at cli/agent/mcp entries; never overrides exported vars) > setting.yaml defaults. Per-role models (planner/extraction/writer/reviewer/checker) are separately configurable under `llm:`.
- ReAct runtime knobs: `llm.temperature` (main agent sampling), `llm.recursion_limit` (default 25; each tool round costs ~2 super-steps — do not lower it below ~12 or the agent gets cut off mid-workflow).
- Embeddings use a **local Ollama** server (`qwen3-embedding:8b` at `localhost:11434`) — Stage 2/4 retrieval requires it running; retrieval falls back to TF-IDF/BM25 when unavailable.
- Stage 1 PDF→Markdown conversion uses the **MinerU cloud API** (needs a token); pre-existing literature assets skip it entirely.
- With no/invalid API key the system runs in deterministic pipeline mode (offline fallback) and the gates still advance.

## Architecture

### Layer 1: Agent orchestration — `auto_battery_research/`

- `agent.py` — `ABRAgent`, the global master agent. Per stage: builds a stage prompt, drives the backend ReAct loop, then runs deterministic executors. Self-correction: on `Check` failure the `failure_summary` (error_code/error/next_action) is stored in `last_failure` and injected into the **next retry's prompt** (【上一轮门禁驳回】block). LangGraph `thread_id` is `abr_{goal_md5[:8]}_stage_{id}` — stable across retries within a stage so `MemorySaver` thread memory accumulates.
- `backend/langchain_backend.py` — LLM runtime. Builds the agent via `langchain.agents.create_agent` (langgraph's `create_react_agent` is deprecated, V2.0 removes it) with a fallback chain: create_agent → create_react_agent → raw `model.bind_tools`. On `GraphRecursionError` it harvests the partial message state from the checkpointer instead of discarding it. `ContextTrimmer` drops orphan `ToolMessage`s whose `AIMessage(tool_calls)` was trimmed away.
- `backend/loop_runner.py` — `AutonomousLoopRunner`: non-LLM deterministic fallback loop (tips → pipeline → check → journal → complete, with retry/self-heal).
- `workflow/stage_manager.py` — `StageManager`, the 6-stage state machine. Stages are **declaratively defined** in `workflow/abr_workflow.yaml` (keys, checker classes, expected_outputs, skip flags); checkers are loaded by import path string — **a failed checker load is fail-closed** (`CHECKER_LOAD_ERROR`, the gate always fails until the yaml/import is fixed), never silently substituted with an always-pass checker. On startup it auto-detects existing data assets and pre-passes completed stages; the pointer lands on the last stage when everything is done. `get_task_output_dir()` names task dirs `slug45_md5(goal)[:8]` to avoid prefix collisions, but **adopts legacy un-hashed dirs** whose `.stage_state.json` target matches (don't break existing tasks on upgrade).
- `checkers/` — one deterministic gate checker per stage (`BaseChecker` subclasses). `Check` = diagnose only (no state change); `Complete` = verify then atomically advance the stage pointer. **Path resolution is task-first**: checkers prefer `stage_manager.get_task_output_dir()` artifacts; the global `output/auto_battery_research/` fallback is gated by `BaseChecker.allow_global_legacy_fallback` — only adopted legacy task dirs (un-hashed `output/tasks/{slug45}/`, `StageManager.is_legacy_task`) or standalone checkers (no stage_manager) may read global artifacts; new hashed tasks must be self-contained and never read global. `auto_detect_existing_progress()` enforces strict sequential-prefix claiming: a downstream stage is only auto-claimed when every prior stage is terminal-OK.
- `tools/` — the agent's toolbox:
  - `domain_tools.py` — 9 stage domain tools (`Inspect*` asset probes + `Ingest/Index/Extract/RunRAGDesign/Run/Synthesize` executors). Stage 4 is converged to a single `RunRAGDesignTool` — all entry points (CLI/TUI/Web/MCP/Agent) go through the one `run_rag_design` service (Planner/Retrieval/Writer/Reviewer live pipeline-internally in `src/lmllm/RAG/`); nothing else may write `design_scheme.*`.
  - `stage_tools.py` — workflow guardrail tools (`CurrentTips`, `Status`, `Check`, `Complete`, `SetStageJournal`, `SkipStage`, `EnableStage`). They read the module-level singleton wired via `set_stage_manager()`; the singleton + per-goal cache are guarded by `_MANAGER_LOCK` (Gradio handlers run threaded). The web UI queues events with `default_concurrency_limit=1` — do not raise it, tool runtime state is process-global. **Always fetch managers via `get_stage_manager_for_goal(goal)`** (reuses the global singleton or a per-goal cache) — constructing `StageManager` directly triggers the full checker cascade + state double-write and can race the main flow.
  - `workflow_actions.py` — the bridge from tools to real work; fail-closed: when assets are missing it actually runs the pipelines (imports `step_mineru/step_merge/step_classify` from `auto_battery_research.pipeline.incremental`, subprocesses `miner/paragraph_metadata_pipeline_v5_qwen.py --incremental`, imports `run_tok2000` via `auto_battery_research.mining`). `_merged_literature_dirs()` resolves merged-literature dirs as: canonical `paths.papers_merged_dir` (`papers/merged`) + legacy `papers/text_merged` where the old cleaning pipeline's data lives — count both, don't hardcode either.
  - `rag_adapter.py` — bridges Stage 4 to the RAG engine in `src/lmllm/RAG/` and converts results into the Stage 4 output contract. Validates fail-closed **before** writing, stamps `review_status: APPROVED|REJECTED` into `design_scheme.json` (consumed by `agent.py`'s scheme-valid precheck), always writes the artifacts (REJECTED output is kept for diagnosis), and pins a `provenance` block (corpus manifest hash / vector-index fingerprint / `RULES_VERSION` from `relation_engine.py`) plus `research_context.json` for reproducibility.
  - `mcp_server.py` — MCP stdio server.
- `mining/`, `pipeline/`, `rag/`, `simulation/` — unified import facades re-exporting the legacy implementations (`agent/*`, `src/lmllm/RAG/*`, `pinn/*`); prefer these over importing legacy locations directly. Heavy deps (pybamm/chromadb/torch) stay guarded inside the source modules.
- `tui/`, `web/` — Textual TUI; web: FastAPI read-only monitor (`web/server.py`, main `--web` entry, parses task state from disk without constructing StageManager) + legacy Gradio dashboard (`web/app.py`, `--web-gradio`).

### Layer 2: RAG engine — `src/lmllm/RAG/`

Multi-agent material-screening RAG: **Planner → Retrieval → Writer → Reviewer** (`agents.py`, orchestrated by `rag_pipeline.py`). Key pieces: `multi_retrieval.py` (hybrid Chroma + BM25/TF-IDF), `relation_engine.py` (thermodynamic hard constraints **C1–C8** that every design scheme must pass), `structured_output.py`, `prompts.py` (central prompt registry).

### Layer 3: Legacy stage scripts (subprocess-scheduled; `agent/`, `pinn/`, `src/lmllm/RAG/` are also imported via the Layer 1 facades)

- `preprocessing/` — PDF → DOI extraction → MinerU Markdown → merge (Stage 1)
- `miner/` — paragraph semantic labeling + Chroma vectorization (Stage 2); `miner/paragraph_metadata_pipeline_v5_qwen.py --incremental`
- `agent/` — 2000-token material mining, normalization, cell entity assembly, ML dataset export (Stage 3); `agent/pipeline_tok2000.py`
- `pinn/` — PyBaMM Newman P2D runner + literature-anchor validation (Stage 5)

Entry wrappers: `pipeline_incremental.py` (legacy pipeline wrapper; core in `auto_battery_research.pipeline.incremental`), `auto_battery_research_cli.py` / `abr_cli.py` (CLI), `scripts/legacy_rag/chat_rag_v3_optimized*.py` / `chat_rag_v5_demo.py` (archived standalone RAG chat demos).

### Data flow / paths

All paths are configured in `auto_battery_research/setting.yaml` under `paths:` (relative to repo root). **Artifacts are task-scoped: each goal gets `output/tasks/<sanitized-goal>/`** and multi-goal runs never overwrite each other. The global `output/auto_battery_research/` is a read-only fallback for legacy artifacts only — do not add new writes there.

```
papers/pdf → papers/merged (canonical; legacy data in papers/text_merged) → database/type/{battery system}/{cathode,anode,electrolyte}
→ miner/json/metadata/meta_merged.json + miner/chroma/paragraphs_q (Chroma)
→ output/tasks/<goal>/
     .stage_state.json · stage_journals.json/.md · cell_assembly/
     design_scheme.md/.json · rag_result.json · simulation_result.json · final_research_report.md
```

## Important Behaviors

- **Stage 5 (PINN physics) is skipped by default** (`skip_pinn_default: true`); enable with `--with-pinn` or `abr-cli --enable-stage 5`. PyBaMM requires Python < 3.13. **Its internals are reserved/placeholder** (simulated fallback values in `pinn/p2d_runner.py`, default residual in `pinn_physics_checker.py`) — leave them alone unless asked.
- Workflow state is sticky **per goal**: `output/tasks/<goal>/.stage_state.json` is reused across runs. After changing stage deliverables/code, use `abr-cli --reset` (or delete that goal's state file) to force re-evaluation from Stage 1.
- Strict mode (`runtime_options.strict_mode: true`) makes hard checkers fail the stage on any error; `max_retries_per_stage: 3` bounds self-healing loops.
- Stage rule from the mission system prompt: never fabricate data — "有则提取、无则留空、禁止编造" (extract what exists, leave blank otherwise, never invent). Design schemes must pass all C1–C8 constraints in `relation_engine.py`.
- Windows is the primary dev platform — entry points reconfigure stdout/stderr to UTF-8; keep that pattern when adding new entry scripts.
- Unit tests must stay offline: `tests/test_abr_agent.py` injects `OFFLINE_CONFIG` (dummy key) so no live API calls happen. Anything needing live services gets the `external` marker.
- When adding a new checker or stage, register it in `workflow/abr_workflow.yaml` (checker classes are resolved by dotted import path) — `StageManager` discovers everything from there.
